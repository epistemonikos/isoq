    "when_use_p1": "You can begin using this tool once you have finished the study screening process and have a list of included studies that meet the inclusion criteria for your synthesis (systematic review). In the early stages of a systematic review, the iSoQ tool can be used to help organise some of the data that are needed to apply GRADE-CERQual, for example, tables of the characteristics of included studies and of the methodological limitations of the included studies (critical appraisal tables).",
    "when_use_p2": "The primary function of the tool is to assist review authors with managing the process of applying the GRADE-CERQual approach to their review findings.

When our Excel template is downloaded and opened in Excel for Mac, columns A and B are merged instead of separate. This causes import failure and serious malfunctioning in the software. We therefore recommend Mac users work on the template in either Google docs, Open Office or LibreOffice. Be sure to save the file as a \"comma-separated values\" (CSV).
