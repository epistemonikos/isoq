      <p>Facilitating access to information on iSoQ development </p>
      <ul>

          Users are now prompted to sign-up to the GRADE-CERQual newsletter when they create an account or change their password. GRADE-CERQual newsletters are sent three times a year and include the latest news about the iSoQ platform, upcoming training or webinars, and other resources for applying the GRADE-CERQual approach

      <p>We have redesigned the My Data page for easier navigation</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A table of contents on the left makes visualising and moving between each step easy
        </li>
        <li>
          Edit and delete buttons for each row in the tables (step 3&4) remain visible even when scrolling
        </li>
        <li>
          Scroll over the Authors names to see the title of the paper in Steps 3&4
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>No more jumping! </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Previously iSoQ defaulted to jumping to the top of the page when the user navigated between pages. Now iSoQ holds your spot on the page thus reducing scroll time.

         You will notice this enhancement especially when navigating back and forth between the iSoQ table and he GRADE-CERQual assessment worksheets for each finding.
